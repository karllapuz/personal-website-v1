				PROJECTS

			<p>
				I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at San Jose State University. My interests include web development, mobile app development, and computer graphics. Apart from my heavy skill set in programming, I am also equipped with the knowledge of digital arts and media. The integration between technology and art has always amused me and I would like to focus my career on a creative balance of both. It is truly fascinating to see how they both work well together to create innovative results.
